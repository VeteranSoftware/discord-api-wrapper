// Intents - Maintaining a stateful application can be difficult when it comes to the amount of data you're expected to process, especially at scale.
//
// Gateway Intents are a system to help you lower that computational burden.
//
// When identifying to the gateway, you can specify an intents parameter which allows you to conditionally subscribe to pre-defined "intents", groups of events defined by Discord.
//
// If you do not specify a certain intent, you will not receive any of the gateway events that are batched into that group.
